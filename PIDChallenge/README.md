# PIDChallenge
Following the tutorial and Google research, I was able to get pretty close to the target graph. 

Points of Difficulty: 
- Finding/Creating equations for I and D values
- Understanding how each value (P, I, D) affected the graph
- Tweaking values to achieve results

Takeaways:
- Better Understanding of Jupyter Notebook environment as a whole
- Understanding different controllers and how different values affect reaching the optimal/desired state
